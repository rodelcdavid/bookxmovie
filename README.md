# Project Title

bookXMovie

## Description

A fullstack web app to show and vote for which version was better â€” book or movie? Combined both Google Books API and TMDB API to create my own database.

## Motivation

I created this project to showcase my abilities in full stack development. Also, I wanted to create a collection where I can compare books and movies and see what others think about them.

## Usage

There are 2 ways to use the app depending on the role.

Admin

1. Login as admin
2. As admin, you can find books and movies and match them together and add to database.
3. You can also delete a matchup and edit votes.

User

1. Login/Signup as User, or use a tester account.
2. After logging in, you can now vote for either book or movie.
3. You can show/hide the stats of a matchup by clicking the three dots in the card.
4. You can also remove and update your vote.
